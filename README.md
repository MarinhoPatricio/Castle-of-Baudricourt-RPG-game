# Castle of Baudricourt RPG game

<p> This is a text-based RPG game made in Python. It's still in an early stage, but already functional. The main goal behind this project was to test my knowledge of Python, a programming language I recently started studying.

<p> The game features three races: Human, Dwarf and Elf. Each of them can play as one of three different roles: Priest, Templar or Rifleman.

<p> Since the game includes three different types of monsters, the "build" you choose (race, role and weapon) will significantly impact your gameplay.

<p> Each role has a corresponding weapon. Players can use any weapon they like, but it will be less effective when wielded by a role other than the one it was designed for. Some weapons grant bonuses that make it easier to defeat certain monsters.

### Next updates:
<p> As the game is still in its early stages, many changes, improvements and fixes will be needed. In future updates, I plan to add:


<ul>
  <li>📝 More usable items, such as armor, potions and others.</li>
  <li>📝 A difficulty adjustment system (normal, medium and hard modes) that changes the damage and HP of monsters.</li>
  <li>📝 An XP and leveling system.</li>
  <li>📝 Monsters with dialogue.</li>
  <li>📝 Balancing HP and damage values for both players and monsters, as well as reviewing bonuses and modifiers.</li>
</ul>
