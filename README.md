# Castle of Baudricourt RPG game


<p> This is a text-based RPG game made in Python. It's still in an early stage, but already functional. The main goal behind this project was to test my knowledge of Python, a programming language I recently started studying. As such, the systems and mechanics are being changed and improved over time.


## Overview

### Plot

<p> You are entering a haunted castle, and it is your duty to fight monsters, complete missions, and free it. To do so, you will face enemies and nightmares of all kinds. 

### Some features

<p> The game features three races: Human, Dwarf and Elf. Each of them can play as one of three different roles: Priest, Templar or Rifleman. As in any RPG game, the "build" you choose (race, role etc) will significantly impact your gameplay: from HP and bonuses to the type of items you can use. Each role has a corresponding weapon and armor. Players can use any weapon they like, but it will be less effective when wielded by a role other than the one it was designed for.
